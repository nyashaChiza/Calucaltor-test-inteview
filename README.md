# Calculator Class Unit Testing

Welcome to the Calculator Class unit testing exercise! In this exercise, you will be writing unit tests for a simple calculator class.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open the `src/calculator.py` file. This file contains the implementation of the `Calculator` class, which provides basic arithmetic operations.

4. Study the `Calculator` class and understand its methods (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) and their expected behaviors.

5. Open the `tests/test_calculator.py` file. This file is where you will write your unit tests for the `Calculator` class.

6. Implement unit tests for each method of the `Calculator` class. Ensure that you cover different scenarios, including edge cases and potential error conditions.

7. Run the unit tests using pytest, a popular testing framework for Python. To run the tests, execute the following command:

8. If all tests pass, commit your changes:

9. Create a new branch for your changes:

10. Push your changes to the new branch:
 ```
 git push origin "<Your Name>/unit-tests"
 ```

11. Create a pull request (PR) for your changes to be reviewed and merged into the main branch. You can do this on the repository's web interface or using the command line:
 ```
 git push -u origin "<Your Name>/unit-tests"
 ```

 This will create a new branch on the remote repository and set up a pull request for it.
