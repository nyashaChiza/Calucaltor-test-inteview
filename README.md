# Calculator Class Unit Testing

Welcome to the Calculator Class unit testing exercise! In this exercise, you will be writing unit tests for a simple calculator class.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Open the `src/calculator.py` file. This file contains the implementation of the `Calculator` class, which provides basic arithmetic operations.

4. Study the `Calculator` class and understand its methods (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) and their expected behaviors.

5. Open the `tests/test_calculator.py` file. This file is where you will write your unit tests for the `Calculator` class.

6. Implement unit tests for each method of the `Calculator` class. Ensure that you cover different scenarios, including edge cases and potential error conditions.

7. Run the unit tests using a testing framework of your choice (e.g., pytest, unittest). Make sure all the tests pass and that the calculator class functions as expected.

8. Feel free to add any additional tests or make improvements to the codebase if you see fit.

9. Once you are done writing and running the unit tests, commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository.
